# Features
- Downloading Beatmaps and Skins directly from the app.
- Adjusting your Osu! Keybinds and Settings without needing to launch the game.
- Running repairs on your Osu! Client.  
- And more features to come

## Why?
This idea originally came from wanting to have a way to unify everything without having to launch the game every time to change the most minor setting.

## Does this bypass supporter ?
No it does not and we do not condone that in anyway, Beatmap downloads are gotten from trusted mirror sites.
